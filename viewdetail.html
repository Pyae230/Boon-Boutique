                <h3>Arabica Coffee Beans</h3>
                <p> Arabica coffee beans, scientifically known as Coffea arabica, are the most 
                    popular and widely consumed coffee beans in the world, accounting for approximately 60%
                     of global coffee production. These beans are renowned for their smooth, mild flavor and
                      complex aroma, making them a favorite among coffee enthusiasts.</p>
                <p> Arabica coffee beans originate from the highlands of Ethiopia.
                     They were first cultivated in Yemen and the Arabian Peninsula before spreading to
                      other parts of the world. The name “Arabica” comes from the beans journey through 
                      Arabia, where they were first roasted and brewed.</p>

                <h3>Robusta Coffee Beans</h3>
                <p> Robusta coffee beans, scientifically known as Coffea canephora, are the second most 
                    popular coffee beans globally, making up about 40% of the world’s coffee production. 
                    These beans are known for their strong, bold flavor and higher caffeine content compared
                     to Arabica beans.</p>
                <p>Robusta coffee beans were first discovered in the Congo during the 1800s. 
                    Unlike Arabica, which requires high altitudes, Robusta can thrive in lowland areas,
                     making it more versatile and easier to cultivate. The beans are primarily grown in
                      tropical regions of Asia and Africa, with Vietnam, Brazil, Indonesia, and India being the main producers.</p>

                <h3>Liberica Coffee Beans</h3>
                <p>Liberica coffee beans, scientifically known as Coffea liberica, are one of the rarest 
                    and most unique coffee beans in the world. They account for less than 1% of global 
                    coffee production, making them a sought-after choice for coffee connoisseurs looking 
                    for something special.</p>
                <p>Flavor Profile Liberica beans are known for their distinctive flavor profile, which is often
                     described as woody, smoky, and fruity. They have a unique aroma and taste that sets them 
                     apart from other coffee varieties. The beans are larger and have an asymmetrical shape, adding
                      to their distinctiveness2.</p>
